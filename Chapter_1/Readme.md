> Rubocop errors reported:

At first Rubocop did not like the double quotes.  It thought I could use single quotes except on the one line that had a word in quotes so they were ok.  This was non-offensive because there was a reason. I choose to fix this by using the single quotes.  If Rubocop is happy, I am happy.
