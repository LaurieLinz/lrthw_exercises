Questions:

> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

 #1 Reading and writing.  #2 Attention to detail #3 Spotting differences

> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

You need to be able to read and more specifically type.  You will also need to learn (if you do not already know) all the symbols.  Once you write/type it you need to be able to read the code so you can incorporate the next two skills.
  
  What seems to separate really good programmers is attention to detail and the ability to spot differences.  This form of pattern recognition and it's practice will really help you to improve.  
  

> Why do you need to not copy and paste?

There is no point to copy and paste in an exercise like this.  You are trying to learn the patterns and build them into muscle memory.  Cut and paste is a waste of time and will not help you learn to code. 

> Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Nothing worth doing is easy the first time or even the first 50 times.  It will hard and challenging at first but if you keep at it you will learn.
