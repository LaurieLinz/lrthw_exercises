#### Study Drills and Questions Chapter 4

For the no method error on line 14, his error was that he had one backtick and one single paran and that triggered the error. 

1. I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?
> Since we are talking about people here it is best to keep it at 4.0.  Since we cannot put a third of a person in a car we need to make sure it is done in whole numbers. 


2. Remember that 4.0 is a floating point number. It's just a number with a decimal point, and you need 4.0 instead of just 4 so that it is floating point.
> Again we cannot divie up people so we need to keep this. 

3. Write comments above each of the variable assignments.

4. Make sure you know what = is called (equals) and that it's making names for things.
> Do not confuse this with == which checks to see if both sides are equal

5. Remember that _ is an underscore character.

6. Try running ruby from the Terminal as a calculator like you did before and use variable names to do your calculations. Popular variable names are also i, x, and j.
```
2.2.4 :010 > cars = 10
 => 10
2.2.4 :011 > cars * 4
 => 40
2.2.4 :012 >
```
